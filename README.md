# CS 294: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Fall 2017 - Homework

The course website : http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/

Here are my solutions for CS 294 in Pytorch.
I covered this course remotely and therefore I don't guarantee my solutions are perfect.
Some given codes originally depended on TensorFlow are modified for PyTorch. I worked the assignments to improve my Pytorch skills and understanding RL.


## Dependencies: 
* PyTorch 0.4.0
* MuJoCo version 1.31
* OpenAI Gym 0.9.1

## HW1
* Behavior Learning
* DAgger

## HW2
* Policy Gradient

## HW3
* Deep Q-Network with target network on Atari
